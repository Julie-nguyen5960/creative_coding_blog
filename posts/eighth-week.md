**3. brainstorm some ideas for your AT3. In your discussion, refer:**

**- to the communities listed above**

Out of all the five CoPs I have listed, I gravitate towards the idea on basing my assignment 3 on anime, volleyball or guitar hero (my most recent hobby). These communities have built me as a person and what would make me distguishable as an individual.

**- why these ideas might be interesting, with reference to Ngai's aesthetic registers**

Because these communities outline one's interests and hobbies, making them distinctive from others and as a form of artistic expression. This is considered interesting as this provokes thoughts and stimulates curiosity- more about noticing and thinking about how these hobbies would shape me as a person.

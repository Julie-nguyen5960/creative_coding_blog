**- list the domain, repertoire, and values of creative coding**

Creative coding:

- Domain (area of interest/shared topic to bring group together): Creating art through code and using it in different ways.

- Repertoire (Shared tools, practices, language and routine): Discord for communication, different coding languages and libraries (p5.js, RiTa, and many more),

- Values: Be open to feedback on your work, Know that people learn at different paces

**3. brainstorm some ideas for your AT3. In your discussion, refer:**

**- to the communities listed above**

Out of all the five CoPs I have listed, I gravitate towards the idea on basing my assignment 3 on anime, volleyball or guitar hero (my most recent hobby). These communities have built me as a person and what would make me distguishable as an individual.

**- why these ideas might be interesting, with reference to Ngai's aesthetic registers**

Because these communities outline one's interests and hobbies, making them distinctive from others and as a form of artistic expression. This is considered interesting as this provokes thoughts and stimulates curiosity- more about noticing and thinking about how these hobbies would shape me as a person.

# Homework 8b

**1. In teams of 2 or 3, use flok.cc to stage a 6-24 minute, collaborative live coding performance that uses:**

- hydra for visuals (Me- Julie)

- strudel for audio (My partner- Waikei)

**2. Take a screen recording of the performance, upload to YouTube, and embed it in a blog post that discusses the practice of live coding. Please include in your discussion:**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y98YHzGGLC0?si=vHLG1te7R7W7qJXB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

a description of what live coding is

- Live coding is a performative art where an individual or groups of people code live and in real time, demonstrating how code can be manipulated to generate art, sounds, visuals and other media forms.   

the differences between live coding and other forms of music performance for:

- The major differences between live coding and the other forms of music performances is the medium used to execute these tasks, where live coding requires a computer whereas a music performance utilises real instruments and an ochestra. Live coding can recreate the sounds of a musical performance with the use of Strudel and its notes, but a music performance requires a lot of training and performing the instrument well.


the audience

- Live coding caters more towards students or the general public who are trying to learn how to code and further enhance their problem-solving skills through watching someone code in real time. 


the performer

- This also helps the performer enhance their problem-solving skills whilst demonstrating to the audience in how flexible coding is for creating visuals and sounds.


**an account of your own experience doing live coding, with reference to both:**

aspects that you found frustrating

- Whenever my code would not work or not run the sketch despite me cross-checking with my references. The function to run the sketch doesn't work properly for me sometimes so I would need Waikei to run the sketch for me instead.

aspects that you found rewarding

- The most rewarding part is when Waikei and I worked together to create mesmerising visuals and sounds, making us feel like we have accomplished something.

**3. Include in your blog post a discussion about the live coding community of practice. Please include:**

some links to live coding content that you find interesting, and why

[Website we used for Hydra](https://hydra-book.glitch.me/#/)

[Website we used for Strudel](https://strudel.cc/workshop/first-sounds/)

- It contains several tutorials and examples in how to code for these libraries, showing that there is a wider community of programmers that are willing to help out people who just started.

a description of this community's domain, repertoire, and values

- **domain-** Creating art through coding.

- **repertoire-** Discord, blogs, youtube and many other sources

- **Values-** Learning is part of the process and keep trying.

some discussion regarding the relation (if any) between cultural performance practices (music, theatre, art, etc.) and:

**young people's intrinsic motivations for learning**

- There are youtube tutorials for these things and many websites that appeal to young people's motivation to learn. It is an acquired skill that builds overtime the more you do it.

education systems & pedagogy

- They are connected in how they provide a source for learning and a sense of community.

discourse / public debate, more broadly

- 

legislation

-

# Homework task 2a

**♦ cute visuals-**

 To encapsulate cuteness, these visuals need to consist of mostly rounded lines and edges to make the object or character more approachable. The use of pastel colours will also aid in making the sketch appear more cute. Many cute mascots contain rounded features, big eyes and are usually short. Noteable characters that are considered cute, includes Pompompurin, ShinChan, Chiikawa and Mofusand. In my sketch, I plan to draw up a mascot with rounded features, with a face and drawn with soft lines. The concepts I will utilise for this sketch is Image(), loadImage(), colorMode (HSB), and fill().

**♦ cute sounds-**

 I think what makes a sound 'cute,' it is usually short, simple and quick. It also consists of a lighter sound, and is higher in pitch just like how Alvin and the Chipmunks covers and nightcore were popular back then. Most tiktok songs are sped-up songs whilst also adjusting the pitch to make the song sound more 'cute.' There are instances where Anime characters try to appear cute sounds through small breath sounds and unique eating sounds. In order to implement sounds into the sketch, I will need to use the functions of function setup(), loadSound() and let playing = false;.

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`cute audio`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 10 + 30

</script>


**♦ cute interactions-**

In order to create cute interactions, the cute characters have to be interactive with the user like Bonzi buddy who is able to talk and dragged anywhere on the screen. I plan to have a similar mechanic of being able to drag the character around inside the canvas. I will utilise the mouseButton(), mouseClicked() and mouseDragged() to enable draggability and hopefully elicit some sound.

# Homework task 2b
Based on the description of a 'kindred spirit,' my mind gravitated toward a special friend who guided me on the path of self-discovery and served as a positive influence in my life. Our first meeting was very spontaneous- we met through an arcade session and played Taikou together. It felt like a miracle to meet someone with so much in common. He introduced me to many different hobbies, encouraged me when I felt down and provided me positive outlook on life. 

1. Please describe the kindred spirit for whom your AT1 is an offering.

**- what is the context of your kinship?**

I'm basing this assignment on a kinship shared between me and my friend, I see him as someone who has guided me through life and its circumstances. Even though, we do not talk to each other often, I still feel that we have stayed close and whenever we get the chance to hang out, it's always a pleasure to spend time with him. He also helped me  further shape my identity through our exploration of different hobbies, such as DDR, Taikou, photography and much more.

**- what is your common purpose?**

Despite us being in different stages of life, we share the common purpose of wanting to live spontaneously and are willing to try the many things that life has to offer. 

**- who or what is your shared challenge / adversary?**

Our shared adversity is mainly our self-esteem, lack of confidence and our need to constantly grow as a person. I believe that there's always room to improve as a person. We always try to uplift each other with positive affirmations and compliments, it always helps me gain more confidence in myself.


2. Explain how your chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of your AT1 idea.

So if I was creating a sketch in tribute to my friend, I would represent him as a bucket hat with a face since he always wore this item whenever we hang out. I plan to include the arcade game Taikou to signify his passion for the game as well as the place where we first met.

In addition to the Taikou drums, I'll add some small drum sounds when the mouse interacts with the drum. Though I am unsure if it is possible to make the bucket hat motif draggable, whilst being able to interact with the drum by simply dragging it over the drum to elicit the sound.

As for the mouse interactions, I was hoping to make the bucket hat motif draggeable and the drums to make a sound once the mouse clicks or hovers over it. It will be short and quick to achieve the essence of cuteness.

# Homework task 2a

Based on the description of a 'kindred spirit,' my mind gravitated toward a special friend who guided me on the path of self-discovery and served as a positive influence in my life. Our first meeting was very spontaneous- we met through an arcade session and played Taikou together. It felt like a miracle to meet someone with so much in common. He introduced me to many different hobbies, encouraged me when I felt down and provided me positive outlook on life. 


**♦ cute visuals-**

So if I was creating a sketch in tribute to my friend, I would represent him as a bucket hat with a face since he always wore this item whenever we hang out. I plan to include the arcade game Taikou to signify his passion for the game as well as the place where we first met.

**♦ cute sounds-**

In addition to the Taikou drums, I'll add some small drum sounds when the mouse interacts with the drum. Though I am unsure if it is possible to make the bucket hat motif draggeable, whilst being able to interact with the drum by simply dragging it over the drum to elicit the sound.

**♦ cute interactions-**

As for the mouse interactions, I was hoping to make the bucket hat motif draggeable and the drums to make a sound once the mouse clicks on it.

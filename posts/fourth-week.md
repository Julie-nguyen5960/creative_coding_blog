# Homework task 4a

Please use either Canvas API or the p5 online editor to create three example compositions, demonstrating:

1. high compressibility

- A sketch that appears more orderly and contains more organised patterns, Make the code more reusable for these objects and compress it into a smaller codes.
<iframe id="pattern" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Julie-nguyen5960/full/CGCNsdsWp"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`pattern`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

2. low compressibility

- A sketch where most things are out of order and random, which makes the code harder to compress due to the different attributes of each object.

<iframe id="doots" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Julie-nguyen5960/full/_3wweTaEW"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`doots`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

3. high effective complexity

- A sketch where it blends the two, high compressibility and low compressibility. It will contain some structure whilst having some random elements.

In his paper, What is Generative Art: Complexity Theory as a Context for Art TheoryLinks to an external site. (2003), Philip Galanter writes that " ... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder. " Why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?

- Embed and refer to the three examples created above to support your explanation.

- In your third example, what concepts and code are responsible for creating structure, in this sense?

## Sabato Visconti

- The artist Sabato Visconti has specialised in various forms of media, including photography, illustration, 3D art, and most notably, glitch art. His ability to capture randomness whilst keeping some form of structure enabled him to achieve such complexity through his works. He has achieved this through several techniques such as pixel art, animation, neon colours, and photography to blend all these medias together.

# Homework task 4b

Use techniques from GlitchLinks to an external site., or Pixel SortLinks to an external site., or both, to render a self-portrait on your blog.

- show your commented code in a syntax-highlighted code-block

How does rendering your likeness in this way affect its aesthetic register? In your discussion, please refer to:

- one or more readings from "Glitch Readings"
- one or more readings from "Net Art Readings"
- the concept of effective complexity
- Ngai's three aesthetic registers

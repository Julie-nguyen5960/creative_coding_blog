# Homework task 4a

Please use either Canvas API or the p5 online editor to create three example compositions, demonstrating:

1. high compressibility
2. low compressibility
3. high effective complexity

(try The Coding Train's Algorithmic BotanyLinks to an external site. or Nature of CodeLinks to an external site. playlists for inspiration)

In his paper, What is Generative Art: Complexity Theory as a Context for Art TheoryLinks to an external site. (2003), Philip Galanter writes that " ... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder. " Why might this be useful for the purposes of making generative art?

- Embed and refer to the three examples created above to support your explanation.

- In your third example, what concepts and code are responsible for creating structure, in this sense?

## Sabato Visconti

- The artist Sabato Visconti has specialised in various forms of media, including photography, illustration, 3D art, and most notably, glitch art. His ability to capture randomness whilst keeping some form of structure enabled him to achieve such complexity through his works. He has achieved this through several techniques such as pixel art, animation, neon colours, and photography to blend all these medias together.

# Homework task 4b

Use techniques from GlitchLinks to an external site., or Pixel SortLinks to an external site., or both, to render a self-portrait on your blog.

- show your commented code in a syntax-highlighted code-block

How does rendering your likeness in this way affect its aesthetic register? In your discussion, please refer to:

- one or more readings from "Glitch Readings"
- one or more readings from "Net Art Readings"
- the concept of effective complexity
- Ngai's three aesthetic registers

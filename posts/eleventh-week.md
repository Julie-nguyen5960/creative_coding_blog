# Homework 11a

#### 1. work out how to do screen recording on your computer.

#### 2. record a few minutes of yourself:

- researching your AT3 community of practice

- working on your code

- using online resources to help you with your project

#### 3. use some video editing software to modulate the playback speed your screen recordings

#### 6. use the text from task 5 as a voice-over for your speed-modulated screen recording.

# Homework 11a

#### 1. work out how to do screen recording on your computer.

#### 2. record a few minutes of yourself:

- researching your AT3 community of practice

- working on your code

- using online resources to help you with your project

#### 3. use some video editing software to modulate the playback speed your screen recordings

- speed up the boring bits

- slow down when there is something important or interesting being shown

#### 4. write down your plan for AT3.  Include:

**The domain, repertoire, and values of the community you have chosen**

- As I have stated before, I have chosen volleyball as the community I engaged with the most  and I have selected a few of the domains, repertoire and values from the LM studio.

**Domain-** 

- Initially, the domain was going to be at my volleyball venue but it ended up being my friend's study room.  

**Repertoire-** 

- knowledge and skills that are shared to your peers to help them improve, important fundamentals (receiving, spiking, setting etc.), and Sportsmanship etiquette.

**Values-**

- Community engagement, Collaboration, teamwork, Improvement, enjoyment and sportsmanship.


**An explanation of the code you are planning to use**

I am planning to use p5.js just because I am more comfortable using this and don't feel confident enough to branch out to different coding languages.

**A practical description of what your plan is / how you see it working**

I plan to program a mini game that includes two players passing the ball to eaach other to achieve the highest rally. I just need to see if two players is available on p5.js. I imagine this project as two characters being able to set the ball up everytime they interact with the ball.

#### 5. rewrite the text you wrote in task 4 as a haiku (or similarly short form)

- you may need to iterate with different angles / emphases until you find the version you like

- you can use AI assistance for this task

#### 6. use the text from task 5 as a voice-over for your speed-modulated screen recording.  

- set it to some (copyright free) music

- post it on youtube (or wherever)

- embed it in a blog post

- along with some discussion

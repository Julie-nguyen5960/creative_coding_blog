# Homework 10a

#### 1. brainstorm a way you might incorporate WebRTC API. or WebSockets API into your idea for AT3.

To incoporate WebSockets API,

#### 2. what technical aspects would you need to learn about if you were to implement this?

According to the WebSocket MDN page, I think I would need to learn how to write a WebSocket server in JavaScript (deno), establishing connections and transmitting data etc.

#### 3. what else would you need to learn / do that would make this feasible?

- Look up forums or pages that provide WebSocket tutorials

- ask ChatGPT for help

- Look up YouTube tutorials

#### 4. what would your project gain from such an incorporation?

The implementation of WebSocket would allow the project to become more interactive through its real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. Project will be able to update instantaneously and would display the user activity.

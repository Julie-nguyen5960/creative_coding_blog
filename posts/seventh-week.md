**1. how will you make the sound design for your AT2 function in a chaotic aesthetic register?  What does it mean to be chaotic in the sonic domain? In your discussion, please make reference to:**

effective complexity, paying particular attention to:

- structure - what structures our perception of sound? 



- noise - what differentiates noise from sound, or music?



- voice - what makes voice a separate category of sound?


the role of de-familiarisation (as per Natalie Loveless' talk From Relational to Ecological)

three examples, which can (but don't have to) be taken from the following list:


- MyNoise Generators: Jungle / Water / Fire / Thunder / Storm.

- Pink Trombone

- How to Kill a Zombie

**2. implement an interactive sound design experiment in your blog.**

- you will need to get some form of user gesture for Web Audio API to run.
 
- you can use a library, such as Tone.js or Pizzicato.js, or you can use Web Audio API, or you can use AudioWorklet.

- use a sinusoid to push your sound design into chaos and back every 24 seconds.

- explain your code with the help of syntax-highlighted, commented code blocks

- evaluate the success of your experiment with reference to your discussion in task 1

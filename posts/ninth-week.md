# Homework 9a

#### 1. Use Ollama or LM Studio to download three LLMs from different organisations.  You might want to use LiveBench and / or Chatbot Arena. to help you choose. Run them locally to help you brainstorm some ideas for AT3.  Discuss with each of them:


**the domain, repertoire, and values of the communities of practice you are thinking of engaging**

**brainstorm some interesting ways that you might use code to engage those communities**

**discuss feasibility, including possible tech stacks and deployment options**

**document these interactions on your blog, along with some additional thoughts comparing and evaluating**

- the generated ideas

- the LLMs themselves


#### 2. use Processing to make a gif

- start with this bleuje tutorial.

- take the core concept and put your own spin on it

- you can use AI to help you with this task

- post some documentation of your process, along with the final gif and some additional discussion, to your blog

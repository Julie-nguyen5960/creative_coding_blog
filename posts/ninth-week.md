# Homework 9a

#### 1. Use Ollama or LM Studio to download three LLMs from different organisations.  You might want to use LiveBench and / or Chatbot Arena. to help you choose. Run them locally to help you brainstorm some ideas for AT3.  Discuss with each of them:

**My downloaded chatbots**

- Llama 3.2 1B Instruct

- Phi 3.1 Mini 128k Instruct

- Gemma 3 1B Instruct QAT

**the domain, repertoire, and values of the communities of practice you are thinking of engaging**

- So I have chosen volleyball as the community of practice I'm thinking of engaging with as this is a hobby I actively participate in and know many people who are part of this community. 

**- Llama 3.2 1B Instruct-** It states that the *domain* for volleyball (specifically indoor volleyball), whilst listing out volleyball's *repertoire* as the rules, scoring system, court layouts, equipment (ball and net) and sportmanship etiquette. Llama then outlines volleyball's important *values* of competition, teamwork, sportmanship and enjoyment.

**- Phi 3.1 Mini 128k Instruct-** It refers to its *domain* from its competitive play, recreational nature and a fitness regime for many people. The *repertoire* involves the skills and knowledge that is shared amongst the community and help them improve their volleyball capabilities which is how friendships are formed. Lastly, it lists out the *values* as community engagement, collaboration and learning which I agree with. 

**- Gemma 3 1TB Instruct QAT-**  When prompted to list out the *domains* for volleyball, it includes technical skill development, tactical and strategic play. The *repertoire* involves the important fundamentals, technical skills and conditioning. Similarily, Gemma states that volleyball requires the *values* of collaboration, communication, improvement, growth and enjoyment.  

#### **brainstorm some interesting ways that you might use code to engage those communities**

**- Llama 3.2 1B Instruct-** It suggested coding a sports analytics that would track passing accuracy for each player, simulating model where u can simulate a player's movements, making a virtual coach or virutal practicing tools. 

**- Phi 3.1 Mini 128k Instruct-** Similarily, it suggests a online coaching platform, virtual matchmaking system, interactive training simulations, motivational app, performance analytics and community event planner.

**- Gemma 3 1TB Instruct QAT-** Luckily, Gemma suggest some alternative for beginner coders like me- making a simple tracking with a spreadsheet to track player's stats or simple polls. The more intermediate option consist of dynamic drills that is looping certain drills or an interactive serve or block variation. Lastly, it suggests a game simulation that allows players to create their own virtual court. 

#### **discuss feasibility, including possible tech stacks and deployment options**

**- Llama 3.2 1B Instruct-** The simulation modelling's feasibility is moderate to high and the possible tech stacks include python or C++ and deployment options include AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI platform.

**- Phi 3.1 Mini 128k Instruct-** Depending on what I am developing, most frameworks use a combination of ReactJS and NodeJS framework as it provides both front end and backend capabilities. Common suggestion is using Pandas or NumPy and deployment option could be Heroku.

**- Gemma 3 1TB Instruct QAT-** It recommends having some prior knowledge in HTML/CSS, javascript or Python. Dynamic drill sequencing would require tech stack: Python (Godot or Unity). It recommends Heroku, Nelilfy or AWS Amplify for deployment.


**document these interactions on your blog, along with some additional thoughts comparing and evaluating**

The generated ideas

- I tend to like Gemma and Llama's ideas as it alligned more closely with my ideas or came up with simpler ideas that seem ideal for the volleyball community.


The LLMs themselves

- Whenever I gave them a prompt, I always liked Gemma's or Llama's answers as they provide information in digestible text formats whilst providing much simpler answers than Phi 3.1.


#### 2. use Processing to make a gif

- start with this bleuje tutorial.

- take the core concept and put your own spin on it

- you can use AI to help you with this task

- post some documentation of your process, along with the final gif and some additional discussion, to your blog

# Homework 9b

#### choose a graphical programming language (GPL) you are interested in out of:

- Pure Data

 - <mark>Max MSP </mark>

- TouchDesigner

- Unity Visual Scripting

- Blender Geometry Nodes

- ComfyUI

- other


#### 2. find a tutorial series on this GPL, and follow along until you understand the basics.


#### 3. create a patch that demonstrates what you have learned.

#### 4. document the process in a blog post discussing:

**why you are interested in this GPL**


**how you might use this GPL in your own creative practice**


**the strengths & weaknesses of this GPL vs other GPLs**


**the strengths & weaknesses of GPLs in general, vs text based scripting languages**

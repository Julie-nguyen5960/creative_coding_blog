# Homework 12a

#### Write a blog post discussing whether inclusion should be considered a core, structural pillar of creative coding. Please refer to the following concepts in your discussion:

**digital infrastructure & digital technology-generating capacity**

Pertaining to this concept, inclusion is necessary to open up more perspectives and brings about more imaginations.

**intrinsic / extrinsic motivations for learning**

Inclusion should be represented in a community like this despite one's intentions (unless it's bad). Some people use creative coding as a form of self-expression and some use it for visibility or representation.

**computer science gatekeeping**

Creative coding could be seen as a rebellion against the gatekeeping of computer science education. Inclusion is necessary in building a community to challenge this adversity.

**digital literacy & legislation**

Government had limited access to digital tools, education and internet connectivity so these laws can restrict whoever participates in this culture. People have been advocating for inclusive policies for more inclusion.

**vectoralist / techno-feudalist forms of oppression**

In a world where the digital world is controlled by vectoralist or techno-feudalist's oppression, they control platforms, datas and algorithms for online life. Creative coding can be seen as a way to fight this oppression.

**network effects, switching costs, & interoperability**

Closed platforms makes it harder for people to have access and switching costs restricts users. Inclusivity must create accessable tools and domains for the community.

**extra-institutional hubs of knowledge / the critical posthumanities**

These extra-institutional hubs of knowledge includes Yotube tutorials, discord, tiktok, it has the opportunity to teach others about the community of creative coding. Their ideas closely align with the critical posthumanism. Inclusion is necessary for these communities to continue on with passing that knowledge

# Homework 6a

**1. What is each library for?**

- **q5.js**- A JavaScript library that is powered by WebGPU, designed for (beginner friendly) interactive art.

- **c2.js**- Another JavaScript library that is intended for computational geometry, physics simulation, evolutionary algorithms, and other modules.

- **svg.js**- This library aims to be lightweight in manipulating and animating SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).

**In what ways are they different?**

- All these JavaScript libraries differ in the art that they produce, q5.js is focused on animation and creative coding arts, while c2.js is focused more on geometric, motion graphics. Svg.js is a library that contexualises vector art through code.

**2. Can we use these libraries from within a javascript.? Explain why / why not.**

- Yes you can, because all of these libraries are all written in JavaScript.

**In what situations might a tool like esm.sh be useful?**

- This tool allows for the installation of JavaScript modules solely from the http URLS. It also allows you to import libraries such as RiTa.js and is compatible with typescript.

**3. Use one of these libraries on your blog to demonstrate how to use a signal or envelope to make something change over time.**

**4. In your own words, please give a brief summary of the following texts:**

Information & Thinking by Michel Serres

- Serres describes information as dynamic, messy and multi-directional, meaning information and knowledge is never linear. They believed that noise or disruption was a sign of creativity and could lead to transformation. Hermes (a messenger God) was a noteable example for the passing of knowledge, demonstrating its movement and how this communication was always in transit.

What Is It Like to Be A Fungus? by Merlin Sheldrake

- Sheldrake highlights the interconnectedness that Fungi form underground networks that support other plant life in which perfectly symbolises collaboration and symbosis. He also mentions the psychedelic fungi tends to challenge the minds and blurs the lines between reality and environment. Through this, Sheldrake contends that our understanding of fungi can shape our understanding towards nature and humanity.

Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation by Laboria Cuboniks

- Laboria Cuboniks argues that the alienation that stems from technological advancements should be embraced and serves as an opportunity to abolish oppressive systems. It is a belief system that supports science and technology, in return, believes that something being 'natural' is not always good and should be modified for a better purpose.

# Homework 6b

**1. use either three.js, p5.js, or some other library, to implement a simple shader in your blog.**

**2. choose which text you would like to respond to for your AT2.**

- "Information and thinking" by Michel Serres

**a. pick three passages from the text that speak to you the loudest**

- "Information, in its everyday sense, contradicts that sense several times" (page 14)
- "The universe is made up of matter and information" (page 15)
- "We are not the only ones endowed with the capability to count or remember" (page 16)

**b. pick at least two techniques we have covered over the course of this unit:**

- recursion,
- <mark> glitch, </mark>
- <mark> natural-language processing (RiTa), </mark>
- 3D (three.js),
- signals / envelopes,
- shaders

**c. combine the passages and techniques you have chosen into a rudimentary rough draft for your AT2.**

- you do not need render the passages in your composition explicitly

- it is sufficient for the passages to be informing your creative decisions / influencing the composition, etc.

**3. solicit some critical, constructive feedback from three colleagues. Try to ascertain, from a dialogue with each one, how well your rough draft coheres as:**

**My idea**

I had chosen the text 'Information and Thinking' by Michel Serres, it states that information is a messy thing that arises from noise (disruptive information). I empathise with his point when he says "information of the media thus provides mostly no information" because media is overloaded with information that serves little importance and is only there to take up one's time. I also agree that the passing of information can also be chaotic and messy where information can easily morph into misformation spread amongst a wider community. The truth can easily be manipulated.

The passing of information has become somewhat post-digital through the use of social media and other techological advancements, meaning that many people can obtain such information from all over the world. In a way, it connects us as a community through this common knowledge and proves that information is a thing that should be shared.


Pertaining to my net art, I plan to keep it simple by manipulating elements from RiTa with glitches to demonstrate how words can become miscontrued and become indistinguishable once information becomes more widespread. I have chosen to implement RiTa into my project as I believed this best suits the concept of 'Information and thinking.' I intended for the words to appear messy and chaotic in how they bounced around the canvas whilst shaking uncontrollably. As for the sound, the tone '8n' was used to further push the glitch effect by changing the tone from higher to lower pitches at random intervals. As for effective complexity, I took a passage of text from my chosen text and imported it onto my net art to provide some form of structure or order. The randomness will ocur once I add glitches onto the words and weird sounds in hopes to achieve effective complexity in my artwork.


**A. a response to your chosen text, and why / why not.**

Most said that my idea was thoughtful and clear from how I shed light onto the chaotic nature of media, making it more accessible and relatable to many people. They said I had encapsulated Serre's argument effectively with insightful thoughts and critical understanding. 

**B. an example of the post-digital, and why / why not.**

I also got feedback saying that my idea is a good example of the post-digital, stemming from my ability to blend Serre's concept of 'Information and thinking' with my idea of social media and global information. It alligns well with the post-digital since it shapes the way we think in a society where technology is constantly evolving.  

**C. functioning in a chaotic aesthetic register, with reference to effective complexity.**

They said my idea is a strong response to the chaotic aesthetic register, especially from the way I balanced structured text with glitch-based disruption. My choices in visual and auditory elements were well-justified and alligns well with the theme.

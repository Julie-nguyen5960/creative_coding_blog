# Homework 6a

**1. What is each library for?**

- **q5.js**- A JavaScript library that is powered by WebGPU, designed for (beginner friendly) interactive art.

- **c2.js**- Another JavaScript library that is intended for computational geometry, physics simulation, evolutionary algorithms, and other modules.

- **svg.js**- This library aims to be lightweight in manipulating and animating SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).

**In what ways are they different?**

- All these JavaScript libraries differ in the art that they produce, q5.js is focused on animation and creative coding arts, while c2.js is focused more on geometric, motion graphics. Svg.js is a library that contexualises vector art through code.

**2. Can we use these libraries from within a javascript.? Explain why / why not.**

- Yes you can, because all of these libraries are all written in JavaScript.

**In what situations might a tool like esm.sh be useful?**

- This tool allows for the installation of JavaScript modules solely from the http URLS. It also allows you to import libraries such as RiTa.js and is compatible with typescript.

**3. Use one of these libraries on your blog to demonstrate how to use a signal or envelope to make something change over time.**

**4. In your own words, please give a brief summary of the following texts:**

Information & Thinking by Michel Serres

- Serres describes information as dynamic, messy and multi-directional, meaning information and knowledge is never linear. They believed that noise or disruption was a sign of creativity and could lead to transformation. Hermes (a messenger God) was a noteable example for the passing of knowledge, demonstrating its movement and how this communication was always in transit.

What Is It Like to Be A Fungus? by Merlin Sheldrake

- Sheldrake highlights the interconnectedness that Fungi form underground networks that support other plant life in which perfectly symbolises collaboration and symbosis. He also mentions the psychedelic fungi tends to challenge the minds and blurs the lines between reality and environment. Through this, Sheldrake contends that our understanding of fungi can shape our understanding towards nature and humanity.

Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation by Laboria Cuboniks

- Laboria Cuboniks argues that the alienation that stems from technological advancements should be embraced and serves as an opportunity to abolish oppressive systems. It is a belief system that supports science and technology, in return, believes that something being 'natural' is not always good and should be modified for a better purpose.

# Homework 6b

**1. use either three.js, p5.js, or some other library, to implement a simple shader in your blog.**

**2. choose which text you would like to respond to for your AT2.** 

**a. pick three passages from the text that speak to you the loudest**

**b. pick at least two techniques we have covered over the course of this unit:**

- recursion, 
- <mark> glitch, </mark>
- natural-language processing (RiTa), 
- 3D (three.js), 
- signals / envelopes,
- shaders


**c. combine the passages and techniques you have chosen into a rudimentary rough draft for your AT2.**

- you do not need render the passages in your composition explicitly

- it is sufficient for the passages to be informing your creative decisions / influencing the composition, etc.


**3. solicit some critical, constructive feedback from three colleagues.  Try to ascertain, from a dialogue with each one, how well your rough draft coheres as:**

**A. a response to your chosen text, and why / why not.**

**B. an example of the post-digital, and why / why not.**

**C. functioning in a chaotic aesthetic register, with reference to effective complexity.**


**4. use these responses to help devise a plan for the next phase of your AT2 project.**

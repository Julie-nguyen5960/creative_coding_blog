# Homework 6a

**1. What is each library for?**

- **q5.js**- A JavaScript library that is powered by WebGPU, designed for (beginner friendly) interactive art.

- **c2.js**- Another JavaScript library that is intended for computational geometry, physics simulation, evolutionary algorithms, and other modules.

- **svg.js**- This library aims to be lightweight in manipulating and animating SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).


**In what ways are they different?**

- All these JavaScript libraries differ in the art that they produce, q5.js is focused on animation and creative coding arts, while c2.js is focused more on geometric, motion graphics. Svg.js is a library that contexualises vector art through code. 

**2. Can we use these libraries from within a javascript.? Explain why / why not.**

- Yes you can, because all of these libraries are all written in JavaScript.

**In what situations might a tool like esm.sh be useful?**

- This tool allows for the installation of JavaScript modules solely from the http URLS. It also allows you to import libraries such as RiTa.js and is compatible with typescript.

**3. Use one of these libraries on your blog to demonstrate how to use a signal or envelope to make something change over time.**

**4. In your own words, please give a brief summary of the following texts:**

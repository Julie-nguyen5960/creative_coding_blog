# Homework task 3a

1. Revisit the work of Rafael RozendaalLinks to an external site.. Choose another, different piece, and describe how he achieves a cute aesthetic register:
   visually
   sonically
   interactively

2. With regard to your AT1, and using embedded p5 sketches, explain how you plan on achieving the aesthetic register of cute:

**- visually**

In a visual sense, I plan to achieve the aesthetic register of cute through the use of rounded shapes and personifying my friend and I as small cute heads within a flower and star border. It will contain adorable elements such as a little drawing sticky note, pastel background and cute icons. The video displayed in the background is meant to replicate the animes we have watched together during quarantine.

**- sonically**

Sonically, I intend to utilise a sped up chatter sound effect similar to animal crossing once our icons are clicked on. The sound from the video in the background will be muted to emphasise more focus onto our icons and other interactive elements.

**- interactively**

In terms of interactivity, the interactive elements will comprise of mouse functions which involves mouseButton(), mouseClicked, mousePressed(), and mouseRealeased(). Most of these functions will account for the drawing pad in my canvas, whilst the 'mousePressed()' will be the only function applied to the cute icons.

3. Enlist some feedback on your ideas from a colleague. Ask them, for each of your examples above:
   how well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?
   what could you try to increase the cuteness?
   how might you use implement these improvements using javascript?
